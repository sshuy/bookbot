# bookbot
Collects information on books and displays that information back to the user of the application.

Currently we have tested this bookbot on three texts.
- Frankenstein (Novel)
- Noises Off (Stage Play)
- Testbook (A local file that was used during testing)

Swapped over to Arch Linux. Need to grab the novels again and perform testing on the new OS.
